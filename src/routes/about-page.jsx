                    Established by The Neighbor in 2018, the M-M Institute is a research and education cooperative funded entirely by donations from the public. Our mission is to provide students with the tools and resources they need to focus on the development of their intellectual and creative potential, and a platform they can use in order to create projects that enrich their respective fields and our community as a whole. We are committed to providing a safe and welcoming environment for all members of the community, and to fostering a culture of mutual respect, tolerance, and understanding. As a cooperative, students are encouraged to take an active role in the development of the Institute, and to participate in the decision-making process that will shape its future. They have a right to vote on proposed policies and budgets, elect committee members, and vote to establish new institutions and programs. We currently have two established schools, the M-M Institute of Technology and the M-M Institute of the Arts, and both have established a number of student led councils that oversee the development of their respective programs. You can learn more about our schools and their respective programs by clicking on the links below.
